# Implementation log — Funny Multi «Чепуха 37»

Session journal. The end-of-session ritual appends one entry per closed task
(`## Step N — title (date)`, **Shipped:** / **Owed:**); the RESUME HERE note at the foot
names the next step. Task blocks: `steering/tasks.md` (active) ·
`steering/tasks-done.md` (closed).

## Backfill — Phases 0–6 (2026-08-12 → 2026-08-16)

Logged retroactively at phase granularity when this log was created (2026-08-20).
Per-task closure notes are in `steering/tasks-done.md`; commit-level detail in git history.
Step numbering starts at Step 1 with the first entry after this backfill.

- **Phase 0 — repo bootstrap** (Gate 0, 2026-08-12). Monorepo skeleton, npm workspaces, CI;
  `npm install` clean, CI green on the empty skeleton.
- **Phase 1 — packages/shared** (Gate 1, 2026-08-12). Rotation formula, answer-pool schema,
  canonical option ids and prompt fragments, hand-authored en/ru pools, socket contract
  adapted to option ids + URL pictures.
- **Phase 2 — server core** (Gate 2, 2026-08-13). Rooms/lobby, round flow with option-id
  answers and reveal prose, disconnect rules (grace window, botification, host migration);
  Gate 2 automated as a full 7-round game over real sockets; i18n coverage tests (T-2.5).
- **Phase 3 — client core** (Gate 3, 2026-08-13, device session logged 2026-08-15).
  Vite/Tailwind/PWA bootstrap with phase routing, Home + Lobby, RoundScreen combobox,
  WaitingScreen + §17 transition lock.
- **Phase 4 — image pipeline** (Gate 4, 2026-08-13→15). R2-cached image Worker,
  deterministic prompt builder, reserve/refund + reveal wiring; device-session results logged.
- **Phase 5 — gallery, end, share** (Gate 5, 2026-08-16). Server stats broadcast, room
  gallery + EndScreen, download/share adapted to URL images; Gate 5 run on two real phones.
- **Phase 6 — 15-language breadth** (Gate 6, 2026-08-16). All 15 languages authored and
  wired (T-6.1–T-6.3); spot-checks (T-6.4) scripted a real RU/zh/he game each through the
  actual render pipeline — RU declined grammar and he RTL structure both read correctly, and
  the check itself caught and fixed two bugs (a zh/ja double-terminal-punctuation bug in
  `ensureTerminalPeriod`, and `he` RTL combobox mirroring never having been
  logical-property-safe).
- **Build state at backfill**: typecheck / lint / format / `npm test` all green locally —
  614 tests across 4 workspaces (82 shared + 307 server + 186 client + 39 worker);
  `npm audit` 0 vulnerabilities; Phase 6 push (`676fd45`) CI green (run 31933503352,
  2026-08-16).

**RESUME HERE (2026-08-20).** Next: **T-7.1 (S)** — PWA install. Manifest, service worker
and `swReload.ts` already landed at T-3.1; remaining per the task block: replace the
placeholder `public/icon.svg` with real artwork, decide whether to ship raster 192/512
icons alongside it, and run the real-device install test on iPhone + Android (the part
that was never automatable). Gate 7 = Lighthouse PWA installable + animation jank check
on a real device. No blockers; CI is green through the Phase 6 push.
